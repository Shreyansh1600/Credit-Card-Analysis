# Credit-Card-Analysis

## PROJECT OBJECTIVE

To develop a comprehensive credit card weekly dashboard that provides real-time insights into key performance metrics and trends, enabling stakeholders to monitor and analyze credit card operations effectively.

This project aims to analyze weekly credit card transaction data coupled with customer information to achieve the following objectives:

- **Measure KPIs**: Analyze Revenue, Transaction Volume, Interest Earned, Delinquency Rate, Customer Acquisition Cost, and Satisfaction Score to assess performance and support data-driven decision-making.

- **Revenue Analysis by Quarter, Week, and Month**: Understand revenue trends, seasonality, and spending fluctuations.

- **Customer Spending Habits and Card Category Analysis**: Explore spending patterns by card category (e.g., Gold, Platinum) and expenditure types (e.g., Bills, Entertainment, Travel).

- **Customer Analysis by Metrics**: Segment revenue based on Education Level, Job Type, and Income Group.

- **Week-on-Week Revenue Comparison**: Detect anomalies, seasonality, and promotional impact for better strategic planning.
